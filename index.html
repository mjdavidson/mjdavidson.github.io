            i like public transport (!) so it seemed fitting for me to be a part
            of making an app to help aucklanders find their way around the city.
            the app is called waka. this was my first time getting stuck into
            any sort of webdev. using react, node and sql server we made waka
            into an easy-to-use, user-friendly app. i got my hands dirty
            building in a feature that shows live bus tracking and bike-share
            locations, and also building the mapping server.

            i currently work at a transport consultancy in north sydney. i've
            created a safety assurance application, that transformed a
            paper-based process into a fully automated and database driven
            workflow. i worked closely in a team of 2, including me and a
            product manager. i used the latest javascript syntax, but had the
            challenge of having to support legacy browsers on government
            computers.

            previously i worked at a small start up in auckland. our
            three-person team made an app called narrative that helps
            photographers easily build blog layouts. i created the

              >subscription management page</a

            and a bunch of other internal tools that the team uses every day,
            including an administration portal for managing existing customers.
            as well as increasing my knowledge of javascript and react, this
            experience is honing my coding and communication skills.
